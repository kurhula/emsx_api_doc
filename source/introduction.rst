The EMSX API is available as programmable and with Excel as both COM and Add-In.  The EMSX API provides Bloomberg users with the ability to manage and automate Equities, Futures and Options trading using Microsoft Excel/VBA or creating a custom application in C++, C# (.NET), Python and Java. You can also use Matlab using Trading Toolbox and R.

It also allows users to access the full 2000+ global execution venues available through EMSX.
