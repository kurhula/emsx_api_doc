The IOI API Server provides Bloomberg users with the ability to both publish and listen to the indication of interest messages. (IOI)

The IOI API Server allows sell-sides to publish their IOI messages into Bloomberg and for buy-sides and others to subscribe to the IOI messages from Bloomberg.

The IOIs consists of Equities and Derivatives and this utilizes the same Bloomberg API 3.0 as EMSX API to automate the publishing and subscribing the indication of interest messages.
